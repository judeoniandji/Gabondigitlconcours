## 2024-07-17 - Git Anti-Patterns and Environment Quirks
**Learning:** I made a critical error by attempting to commit Python bytecode files (`.pyc`). The code review correctly identified this as a major anti-pattern. The root cause was that these files were previously tracked by Git, so they were still being staged even though the `.gitignore` file was correct. I also struggled with the test environment, which required a specific command to chain dependency installation with the test execution to avoid `ModuleNotFoundError` and database connection errors.
**Action:** In the future, I will always verify the staging area with `git status` before requesting a code review to ensure only intended source files are included. I will also remember the `pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install bcrypt && DB_USE_SQLITE=True python manage.py test <app_name>` pattern for running tests in this repository to avoid environment-related failures.
